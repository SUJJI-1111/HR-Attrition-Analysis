IBM HR Attrition analysis with Python in Google Colab
# HR Attrition Analysis – IBM Dataset

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of employee attrition using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset**. I’ve built it in **Google Colab**, so it’s easy to upload the dataset, run the analysis, and quickly get meaningful insights.

The main objective is to help HR teams and data enthusiasts understand the key factors that influence employee turnover and how different factors like salary, job role, or overtime might be contributing to it.

## 📂 About the Dataset

The dataset includes real-world HR data from IBM and contains details like:

- Age, Gender, Marital Status
- Job Role, Department, Education
- Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance
- Distance from home, OverTime
- Whether the employee has left the company (Attrition)

These features help in exploring what makes employees stay or leave.

## ✅ What’s Inside This Project

- Manual upload of the dataset through a file picker in Google Colab
- Automated data loading, checking, and cleaning steps
- Multiple charts and graphs to explore patterns in attrition
- Insights about departments, roles, salaries, and demographics
- A correlation heatmap to see how different factors are connected
- A clean and structured notebook to guide users through the analysis

## 📊 Key Visualizations

Some of the charts you'll find in this project include:

- Attrition count across departments and job roles
- Distribution of attrition by gender and marital status
- Impact of monthly income and overtime on attrition
- Age distribution for employees who stay vs those who leave
- Correlation heatmap of all numeric features

These visuals are helpful in identifying trends and making informed decisions.

## 🚀 How to Use This Notebook

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the dataset (CSV or ZIP file) using the file picker.
3. Run all the cells and let the notebook perform the analysis.
4. Explore the results and save screenshots or reports if needed.
